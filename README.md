# CV

My auto-generated CV document. Resume content is written following the
[JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/getting-started/) format. @TODO: How to
`sed` replace absolute path images for built asset? Problem is: `sed` regex.

## Why?

There are multiple visual CV builder out there that works and might fit the
needs of many people. I find those visual-based builder useful to create a
visually appealing CV, but is a nightmare to maintain.

I found a great open source project
[JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/getting-started/) that aims to provide
developers with an easier way to build their resumes. I like this approach very
much, but unfortunately I couldn't really find a suitable theme for me. So I
built this project not only to contain the online version of my resume, but also
as a way to build a more-maintainable resume, all through code.
